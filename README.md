## 🏃‍♂️ Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on activity data exported from **Strava**, a popular fitness tracking and social networking app.  
The main goal is to **analyze user activity patterns** (running, cycling, etc.), identify **key trends**, and derive **business insights** that could improve the Strava user experience and engagement.

---

## 🎯 Objective
The business objective is to:
- Combine multiple Strava datasets into a single structured dataset.  
- Perform data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.  
- Discover patterns in user performance, activity types, and time-based trends.  
- Provide actionable insights for fitness tracking and business strategy.

---

## 📊 Key Analyses Performed
- Data merging and preprocessing of multiple Strava datasets.  
- Handling missing values and inconsistent data entries.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  - Distribution of activity types (running, cycling, etc.)
  - Time-series analysis of workout frequency and distance
  - Correlation between variables such as pace, distance, and calories burned
  - Seasonal trends and user performance metrics
- Visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
- Insights derived from graphs and summary statistics.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries:**
  - pandas  
  - numpy  
  - matplotlib  
  - seaborn  
  - plotly (if interactive charts are used)

---

## 🧩 Dataset Information
The datasets include exported Strava activity logs such as:
- `activities.csv`  
- `gear.csv`  
- `segments.csv`  
- `laps.csv`

Each file contains information about user workouts, performance metrics, and related data.
